# carbon-2021 dp branch

The main purpose here is to replace (where possible) the collection of RetroPie logo art in the default theme with versions that are as authentic as possible.

For this I chose to use the amazing collection from [Dan Patrick](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/85709-dan-patrick/), with his permission, along with some stuff I've modified myself.

It's quite a collection with many variants. I tried to follow his "recommended versions" mostly, prioritizing logos without trademark or brand symbols except in a few cases.

This is a development branch that will change as I experiment with it. As I play with what looks best (to me) in actual use, the versions, sizes, variants, etc. will definitely change.
